"""
Python module that implements the dMST (Minimal Spanning Tree with degree restrictions)
problem from the approach of Genetic Algorithms. It also implements multiobjective
optimization in the sense that finds the Pareto Front formed by the solutions that cannot
be dominated. This is, their total weight cannot be reduced without also reducing the
reliability of the network and viceversa.
